## The ranking rule

A component that exists in **Ionic *and* `@expo/ui` universal** is the strongest signal: both teams
paid the cross-platform unification tax for it. Next strongest is Ionic plus *both* native toolkits.
Weakest is one ecosystem only.

## The admission test — do not skip it

> 🔒 **Ship a primitive when there are at least two platform quirks it would own.**
>
> Fewer than that and it is a styled element with an import cost — more API to document and maintain,
> for nothing. The question is not *"what does the API need to express?"* (right for SwiftUI, where
> `Text` is the only way to render a glyph) but *"where does the framework get somewhere to stand?"*
> Every primitive is one more place adaptv is on the path when a quirk fires, and the developer who
> most needs the fix is exactly the one who will never apply it by hand.

Two costs to weigh against it every time. **A primitive nobody reaches for buys nothing** — if `<p>`
works and `<Text>` is optional, most people write `<p>` and Dynamic Type never happens, so the value
is made in the docs and the playground, not in the code. And **a wrapper costs a component layer per
node**: in a virtualised list of 1000 rows × 3 texts that is measurable, and should be measured
rather than assumed.

## Tier 1 — in the universal set *and* Ionic, and missing from adaptv

`Slider` · `Select`/`Picker` (the *menu* appearance, not just the wheel) · `Collapsible` ·
grouped-settings form (`FieldGroup` / `ion-list inset`) · ~~`Icon`~~.

**`Icon` shipped** (`src/components/icon.tsx`), with no dependency and no bundled icon set: it takes
any set's `<svg>` through `render` and owns two quirks. **Exposure:** a decorative icon is
`aria-hidden`, never `role="none"`, because a named svg is announced through `role="presentation"`
by every reader Manuel Matuzović tested in February 2026 except JAWS (VoiceOver on macOS 26.3 says
"group"); a labelled one is `role="img"` + `aria-label`, the pattern announced as an image in every
pairing Scott O'Hara tested. `lucide-react` 0.544.0 never sets the role, and `ion-icon` sets it even
unlabelled. **Dynamic Type:** the box defaults to `1em`, so an icon inside `Text` follows it, and
`scaleWithSystem` multiplies a fixed-size sibling icon by the same measured factor
`Text scaleWithSystem` uses (Flutter's `Icon.applyTextScaling` is the same idea). The `@expo/ui`
universal `Icon` is not prior art for the web half: its `index.tsx` returns `null`, and only the
`.ios.tsx` / `.android.tsx` files render. Deliberately absent: a `mirror` prop (`rtl:-scale-x-100` is
already Tailwind vocabulary) and a sprite `href`, which brings two more quirks of its own — a `data:`
URL in `<use href>` renders nothing in WebKit or current Chromium while Vite inlines a sprite under
4 KB as exactly that in the production build only, and a `display: none` sprite drops its gradients
(Chromium 41337331, WebKit 243341). A **bundled, named icon set** — which is what would make
automatic RTL flipping possible — is an owner call, not a gap.

**`Slider` and a real `Select` are the clearest holes in the form-control set** — adaptv has
button / input / textarea / checkbox / switch and stops. `WheelColumn` is a partial `Picker`.

## Tier 2 — the feedback layer

`Alert` · `ActionSheet` · `Toast` · `Spinner` · `ProgressBar`. Every native toolkit has these, Ionic
has them, adaptv has none of them.

**Probably one overlay engine plus five thin presets, not five components.** Ionic's five overlays
all share one interface, and adaptv's `Drawer` is *already* an overlay with a gesture engine behind
it — so the engine largely exists.

✅ **The render-vs-delegate decision is made: render.**
[`open-questions.md` O22](open-questions.md) was answered by the owner on 2026-09-09, and it is the
same answer on the capability side ([`capability-gaps.md`](capability-gaps.md) Tier 2). One engine
plus five thin presets, one look on all six targets, full styling control, and modality that stays
inside `BackPriority.Overlay`. The per-platform exception that was on the table — delegating toast
on Android, where it is a real affordance outside the app window — was **considered and not taken**.
The cost carried knowingly is that accessibility for all five is adaptv's work.

## Tier 3 — the app frame (most leverage, most design work)

`TabBar` · nav header / toolbar with back button and large-title collapse · `SearchBar`.

Both ecosystems ship these and **both treat them as routing-level concerns** — `ion-tabs` /
`ion-router-outlet`, and `expo-router`'s `Stack` / `NativeTabs` — rather than as free-standing
components. adaptv owns its router, so this is the piece with the most leverage; it is also the one
that **cannot be lifted from either API directly**.

`expo-router`'s surface is worth reading closely before designing it — it is the layer adaptv already
competes in, and `../research/component-surface.md §7` inventories it prop by prop: typed `Link`
variants (`Link.Preview`, `Link.Menu`, `Link.Trigger`), `Stack.Screen` with its header primitive
family, `NativeTabs` with `NativeTabTrigger`, the declarative `Badge`/`Icon`/`Label` slot children,
and `Slot`/`Navigator` for headless composition.

## Tier 4 — display chrome

`Badge` · `Divider` · `Card` · `Chip` · `Skeleton` · `FAB` · `Avatar`. Cheap, high-frequency,
low-risk, mostly CSS in a DOM framework.

---

## Deliberately absent — do not "close" these

**The layout family** — `Row` / `Column` / `Spacer` / `HStack` / `Grid` / `ion-col`'s 24 props.
It exists in the neighbours because SwiftUI and Compose have no CSS and Ionic predates CSS grid.
adaptv is DOM + CSS: **flexbox already is that API**, and there is no platform quirk a `<Row>` would
absorb that flexbox does not already handle.

---

## What is already done (so the list is not re-derived wrong)

The root `README.md` has described the remaining tail as *"`Text` / `Modal` / `Tabs` polish"*.
**`Text` shipped** (`src/components/text.tsx`) and passes the two-quirk test on iOS Dynamic Type —
where the `font` **shorthand** is required, `font-size` does not work
([`../decisions/prior-art.md §10`](../decisions/prior-art.md)) — plus `text-size-adjust` on rotation,
line clamping, and per-instance selection semantics. **`Modal` and `Tabs` are the real remainder**
(Tier 2 and Tier 3 above).

Also already shipped and easy to mis-list as gaps: `Dropdown` (the menu/popover row), `Image` as a
full compound component with a build-time placeholder pipeline
([`../design/image.md`](../design/image.md)), `Pressable`, `Offline`, `BootError`, `UpdateRequired`,
`OrientationGuard`, `EdgeSwipeGestures`, `PwaSplashOverlay`, `UiNotFound`.
